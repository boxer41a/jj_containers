# jj_containers
This cluster of classes adds useful features to some of the base/elks containers.  For example, features 'is\_all\_same' and 'is\_all\_different' are convinient for comparing items in a list.

Classes JJ\_ARRAYED\_STACK and JJ\_LINKED\_STACK grant access to any item in the stack, not just the top item.

Feature 'prune' removes the first occurrence starting from the beginning of a list instead of starting from the cursor position.
